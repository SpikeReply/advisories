# Authentication Bypass in Fanvil x210 V2 (CVE-2025-64055)
## Summary
We identified an authentication bypass that permits unauthenticated attackers on the local network to access administrative functions of the device (e.g. file upload, firmware update, reboot...). Given the potential of this vulnerability to modify the system configuration, there is a risk that attackers could modify the normal behavior of the device.

## Affected products
- Fanvil x210 V2, firmware V2.12.20

## Details
During an analysis of the latest Fanvil X210 firmware (`X210-V2-2.12.20`, dated **2024-07-30**), a critical security issue was identified. The device’s web application, used for configuration, allows an **unauthenticated attacker on the local network** to bypass the web service authentication.

Analyzing the httpd server configuration, it emerged that authentication is required only on the `/html` path of the web service. This means that any calls to other paths, such as `/cgi-bin` are not authenticated. This allows unauthorized execution of CGI scripts.

## PoC
HTTPD configuration file
```
*.php:/bin/php
/html:root:<PASSWORD>
```

```shell
curl http://192.168.122.246:8080/cgi-bin/webconfig?page=status
```

## Impact
By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers could modify the normal behavior of the device.

## Additional information
Issue fixed on firmware version 2.12.22.2
