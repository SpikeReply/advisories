# Authentication bypass in Tenda N300 Wireless N VDSL2 modem router (CVE-2023-51146) #

## Summary
An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the N300 Wireless N VDSL2 Modem Router, manufactured by Tenda. This vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated user to access sensitive information.

## Affected products
- Tenda N300 Wireless N VDSL2 Modem Router (FW version V53.0.1.6_EN)

Note that this issue may affect also other device models and firmware versions, but they were not checked.

## Details
This issue is an authentication bypass vulnerability that enables an unauthenticated attacker who has access to the router web interface, either locally or remotely, to access resources that would normally be protected.
Specifically, the attacker can construct a web request that includes a white-listed keyword in the path, causing the URL to be served directly (rather than blocked or challenged with an authentication prompt).

## PoC
Omitted.

## Impact
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could grant the attacker access to pages that would otherwise require authentication. An unauthenticated attacker could thereby gain access to sensitive information, such as the Administrative password, which could be used to launch additional attacks.
